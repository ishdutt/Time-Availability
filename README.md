# Time-Availability
A small webpage which fetches data from API and renders the free time of the interns. The published website can be found here https://ishdutt.github.io/Time-Availability/
## Things included:
1.Fetches the data directly from API using XHR calls.<br />
2.Made the tabular layout for storing the data.<br />
3.2nd page creates a timeline graph using google graphs.<br />
4.Added a free time vertical column.<br />

## Objectives that wasn't fullfilled
1.Couldn't add the vertical column for all the free time.I tried it but the page was showing only one of them.<br />
2.The 2nd page is hard coded(uses data which is typed manually).I tried to automate it using a script(through xhr call) but it was showing only the last one user's data.
